# TokenSwap DEX - Complete Project Documentation

## üìã Project Overview

TokenSwap DEX is a fully decentralized exchange (DEX) built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts. It enables users to swap tokens, provide liquidity, and earn trading fees in a trustless, non-custodial environment.

### Key Features

- **Token Swapping**: Exchange between multiple currencies with low fees (0.3%)
- **Liquidity Provision**: Add liquidity to pools and earn passive income from trading fees
- **Multi-Currency Support**: Support for STX, USDC, BTC, EUR, NGN, and more
- **Mobile-First Design**: Fully responsive interface compatible with all devices
- **Automated Market Maker (AMM)**: Uses constant product formula (x * y = k) for fair pricing
- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain full control of their assets

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Smart Contract Layer (Clarity)

The DEX uses a single Clarity smart contract (`token-dex.clar`) that implements:

1. **Liquidity Pools**: Stores token reserves and LP shares
2. **Swap Functions**: Handles token exchanges using AMM formula
3. **Liquidity Management**: Add/remove liquidity operations
4. **Slippage Protection**: min-amount parameters on all trades
5. **Input Validation**: Zero amount checks, balance verification

### Frontend Security

1. **Wallet Connection**: Use official Stacks Connect library
2. **Transaction Signing**: Never store private keys
3. **Input Sanitization**: Validate all user inputs
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent spam transactions

### Best Practices

- Always set appropriate slippage tolerance (0.5% - 5%)
- Check pool reserves before large trades
- Verify token addresses before swapping
- Test on testnet before mainnet deployment

## üåê Deployment Guide

### Deploy Smart Contract

1. **Configure Clarinet.toml**
   ```toml
   [project]
   name = "tokenswap-dex"
   
   [contracts.token-dex]
   path = "contracts/token-dex.clar"
   
   [repl.analysis]
   passes = ["check_checker"]
   ```

2. **Deploy to Testnet**
   ```bash
   # Check contract
   clarinet check
   
   # Deploy to testnet
   clarinet deploy --testnet
   ```

3. **Deploy to Mainnet**
   ```bash
   # Ensure thorough testing first!
   clarinet deploy --mainnet
   ```

### Deploy Frontend

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Connect repository to Vercel
3. Configure build settings:
   ```
   Build Command: npm run build
   Output Directory: dist
   ```
4. Deploy automatically on push

#### Option 2: Netlify

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Import project in Netlify
3. Build settings:
   ```
   Build command: npm run build
   Publish directory: dist
   ```

#### Option 3: Manual Deployment

  "name": "TokenSwap DEX",
  "short_name": "TokenSwap",
  "description": "Decentralized token exchange on Stacks",
  "start_url": "/",
  "display": "standalone",
  "background_color": "#1e1b4b",
  "theme_color": "#7c3aed",
  "icons": [
    {
      "src": "/icon-192.png",
      "sizes": "192x192",
      "type": "image/png"
    },
    {
      "src": "/icon-512.png",
      "sizes": "512x512",
      "type": "image/png"
    }
  ]
}
```

## üîÑ Advanced Features to Add

### 1. Price Charts

```javascript
import { LineChart, Line, XAxis, YAxis } from 'recharts';

const PriceChart = ({ data }) => (
  <LineChart width={500} height={300} data={data}>
    <XAxis dataKey="time" />
    <YAxis />
    <Line type="monotone" dataKey="price" stroke="#8884d8" />
  </LineChart>
);
```

### 2. Transaction History

```javascript
const [transactions, setTransactions] = useState([]);

const fetchTransactions = async (address) => {
  const response = await fetch(
    `https://stacks-node-api.testnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/address/${address}/transactions`
  );
  const data = await response.json();
  setTransactions(data.results);
};
```

### 3. Token Price Oracle

```clarity
;; Add to smart contract
(define-map token-prices
  principal  ;; token address
  uint       ;; price in micro-units
)

(define-public (update-price (token principal) (price uint))
  (begin
    (asserts! (is-eq tx-sender contract-owner) ERR-NOT-AUTHORIZED)
    (ok (map-set token-prices token price))
  )
)
```

### 4. Limit Orders

```clarity
(define-map limit-orders
  {
    order-id: uint,
    owner: principal
  }
  {
    token-in: principal,
    token-out: principal,
    amount-in: uint,
    min-amount-out: uint,
    expiry: uint,
    filled: bool
  }
)
```

### 5. Farming/Staking Rewards

    value: amount,
  });
};

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Pool not found" error**
- Solution: Ensure pool is created before attempting operations
- Check token addresses are correct

**Issue: "Insufficient liquidity" error**
- Solution: Pool doesn't have enough reserves
- Add liquidity or reduce trade size

**Issue: "Slippage too high" error**
- Solution: Increase slippage tolerance
- Split large trades into smaller chunks

**Issue: Wallet won't connect**
- Solution: Ensure Stacks wallet extension installed
- Check network settings (testnet/mainnet)
- Clear browser cache

**Issue: Transaction stuck**
- Solution: Check transaction status on explorer
- Increase fee for faster confirmation
- Wait for network congestion to clear
